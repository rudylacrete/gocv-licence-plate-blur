This is a simple project to demonstrate the use of opencv in Go to automatically blur licence plate. This is based on the tutorial found [here](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/license-plate-detection-and-recognition-using-opencv-and-pytesseract/).

First thing to make it work is to install gocv 4 using [this tutorial](https://gocv.io/getting-started/linux/).

Then you can just run `go run main.go` and update the imgPath const.
